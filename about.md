title: About Me 关于我
---

I am a data analyst with a great passion for data-driven decision making. I have worked on data-powered projects including web-based data visualisation platform, data visualisations, BI dashboards, BI reporting automation and a few intelligent transportation projects.

When I am not working, I spent my time reading useless but interesting books, watching good movies, shooting photos, and playing sports (mainly running and body building). I also like sharing my thoughts on the Internet (mainly technical stuff and my reading notes), but I am not a prolific blogger as I am too lazy.

<br/>

*I am fascinated with the project-driven learning approach. I believe practice makes perfect.*

*I am a big fan of Feynman technique.*

*I firmly believen that **grit + good methods + efficienc** can make us be good at anything.*
