I"…<p>When working with Jupyter Notebook, in many cases we want to share some code blocks between different notebooks to reduce code redundancy.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Good news is that in newer Jupyter, we can achieve this with the <strong>%run</strong> magic command, which allows us to run one jupyter notebook inside another.</p>

<p>For example, we have a jupyter notebook named utility.ipynb, which defines some utility functions to be used by a set of notebooks. Instead of copy and paste the code in each notebook, we can simply add the following code into the top of each notebook:</p>

<pre><code>%run utility.ipynb
</code></pre>

<p>Running the above magic command give us to whatever is defined in utility.ipynb, including both variables and functions.</p>
